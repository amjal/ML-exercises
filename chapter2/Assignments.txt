1. Machine learning researchers often test their algorithms using publicly available
benchmark domains. A large repository of such domains can be found at the
following address: www.ics.uci.edu/~mlearn/MLRepository.html. Take a look at
these data and see how they differ in the numbers of attributes, types of attributes,
sizes and so on.

2. Write a computer program that will use the Bayes formula to calculate the class
probabilities in a domain where all attributes are discrete. Apply this program to
our “pies” domain.

3. For the case of continuous attributes, write a computer program that accepts the
training examples in the form of a table such as the one in Exercise 3 above.
Based on these, the program approximates the pdf s, and then uses them to
determine the class labels of future examples.
4. Apply this program to a few benchmark domains from the UCI repository
(choose from those where all attributes are continuous) and observe that the
program succeeds in some domains better than in others.
